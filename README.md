Mobile-Frame-Zero
=================

Mobile Frame Zero has been released as Creative Commons, but the PDF does not always work on smaller devices. (For example, I would love to have a plain text version of the rules on my Kindle.) In this project I want to create a version of the Mobile Frame Zero Rules only (not the story) as markdown formated plain text.

Please support the Mobile Frame Zero people by buying their PDF or Book, and play the game.

Thanks!
