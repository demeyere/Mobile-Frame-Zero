Mobile-Frame-Zero
=================

Mobile Frame Zero has been released as Creative Commons, but the PDF does not always work on smaller devices. This project wants to create a `markdown` version of the Rules only (not the story). 

Please support the Mobile Frame Zero people by buying their PDF or Book, but more importantly, play the game.

Each Rule Chapter will get it's own file.

Thanks!
